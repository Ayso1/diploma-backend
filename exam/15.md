A Program is an executable file containing a set of instructions and stored passively on a disk.
A Process is the execution of those instructions after being loaded from the disk into memory. It is the instance of a computer program, a program in execution.
A Thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. One process can have multiple threads.

Concurrency is about independent computations that can be executed in an arbitrary order with the same outcome. The opposite of concurrent is sequential, meaning that sequential computations depend on being executed step-by-step to produce correct results.

Difference between Thread and Process:
Process means a program is in execution, Thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
Processes are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process.
Processes take more time to create and terminate than threads.
Unlike processes, which require a message passing or shared memory mechanism to perform inter-process communication (IPC), threads can communicate through data, code, and files they already share.
Each process has its own memory space. Threads that belong to the same process share the same memory.
Context switching between threads in the same process is typically faster than context switching between processes.
