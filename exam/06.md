The abstract data type (ADT) is a data type that focuses on what it does by ignoring how it does.
Best example of this Abstract data type is stack and queue.
Stack having its push and pop operations, but it is implemented using the array or linked list.

Advantages:

1. It is based on the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Software Engineering (SE).
   For example Polymorphism needs the great support of Abstraction to power itself, without Abstraction you cannot leverage the power of Polymorphism.
   Abstract class are used to implement Abstraction, but how things will work? How do you code with abstract things? Well, here Polymorphism helps.

2. An ADT can be re-used at several places, and it reduces the coding efforts
3. ADT ensures a robust data structure
4. Allows better conceptualisation and modelling of the real world

Disadvantages:

1. Greater initial time investment
2. Limit access We, as user of the class (as writer of client code that makes use of the class), may feel limited by the classâ€™ public methods
3. Overhead of calling a method to access ADT information

Properties:

1. It exports a type.
2. It exports a set of operations. This set is called interface.
3. Operations of the interface are the one and only access mechanism to the type's data structure.
4. Axioms and preconditions define the application domain of the type.
