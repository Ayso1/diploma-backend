Algorithm:
An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a particular problem. It is a set of step-by-step instructions that satisfy a certain set of properties.
Properties:
Non Ambiguity
Each step in algorithm should be clear and precise. The instruction in any algorithm should not denote any conflicting meaning. This property also indicates the effectiveness of algorithm.
Range of Input
The range of input should be specified. This is because normally the algorithm is input driven and if the range of input is not being specified then algorithm can go in an infinite state.
Multiplicity
The same algorithm can be represented into several different ways. That means we can write in simple English the sequence of instruction or we can write it in form of pseudo code. Similarly, for solving the same problem we can write several different algorithms.
Speed
The algorithmis written using some specified ideas. Bus such algorithm should be efficient and should produce the output with fast speed.A problem can be solved quickly using a large amount of memory, or slower using a smaller amount of memory.
Finiteness
The algorithm should be finite. That means after performing required operations it should be terminate.
