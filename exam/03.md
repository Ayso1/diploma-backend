Multiplexer is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line.
The demultiplexer is a combinational logic circuit designed to switch one common input line to one of several seperate output line.
An adder is a digital circuit that performs addition of numbers.
Comparators are devices that compare two voltages or currents and output a digital signal indicating which is larger.
An arithmetic-logic unit is the part of a central processing unit that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words.such as addition, subtraction, logic AND, Logic OR. In some processors, the ALU is divided into two units: an arithmetic unit (AU) and a logic unit (LU).
A Register is a device which is used to store such information. It is a group of flip flops connected in series used to store multiple bits of data.
A Counter is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event or process has occurred, often in relationship to a clock signal.
