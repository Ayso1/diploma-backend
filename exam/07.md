Divide and conquer is a recursive problem-solving approach in data structure and algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems, recursively solve each subproblem, and combine the solutions to the subproblems to get the solution of the original problem. So, there are three parts of problem-solving using divide and conquer:
Divide:
We divided problem into one or more that one smaller sub-problems, where sub-problems are the smaller versions of the same problem less input size.
Conquer:
We solve eache sub-problem recursively calling the same function for a smaller input size. Here recursion will automatically do the work for us.
Combine:
We combine the solutions to subproblems to build the solutions to the original problem.
example:
Divide and conquer solution of finding max and min
Divide:
the array into two equal parts around mid-value.
Conquer:
Rercusively find the min and max of both left and right parts.
Combine:
Compare the max and min of both halves to get the max and min of the whole array.
Base class 1:
If subarray is 1 return the element as both max and min.
Base class 2:
If subarray size is 2 compare both elemnts and return max and min among them.
