In computing, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.
A CPU cache is a hardware cache used by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer to reduce the average cost (time or energy) to access data from the main memory.A cache is a smaller, faster memory, located closer to a processor core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations.

How Does CPU Cache Work?
When you run a program, the instructions make their way from the primary storage (your hard drive) to the CPU. This is where the memory hierarchy comes into play.
The data first gets loaded up into the RAM and is then sent to the CPU. CPUs these days are capable of carrying out a gigantic number of instructions per second. To make full use of its power, the CPU needs access to super-fast memory, which is where the CPU cache comes in.
The memory controller takes the data from the RAM and sends it to the CPU cache. Depending on your CPU, the controller is found on the CPU, or the Northbridge chipset found on your motherboard.
The memory cache then carries out the back and forth of data within the CPU. Memory hierarchy exists within the CPU cache, too.
