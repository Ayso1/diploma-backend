Control statements are the statements that change the flow of execution of statements. For example, If, If-else, Switch-Case, while-do statements.
There are three types of control statements:
Conditional/Selection statements
Iteration/Loop statements
Jump statements
1.A conditional statement will select the block of statements that will execute based on the given condition.
2.A looping statement is used when the program requires a statement’s execution until some condition for loop termination is satisfied.
3.Jump statements are statements through which we can transfer control anywhere in the program. These statements will transfer program control by skipping statements that don’t have any specified conditions. These statements are:
1.Break
2.Continue
3.Pass
